.SH NAME
get_iplayer \- Stream Recording tool and PVR for BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBget_iplayer\fR [<options>] [<regex|index> ...]
.PP
\fBget_iplayer\fR \fB\-\-get\fR [<options>] <regex|index> ...
.PP

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBget_iplayer\fR lists, searches and records BBC iPlayer TV and BBC Sounds radio programmes.
.PP
\fBget_iplayer\fR has two modes: recording a complete programme for later playback, and as a Personal Video Recorder (PVR), subscribing to
search terms and recording programmes automatically.
.PP
If given the regex ".*" (incl. quotes), \fBget_iplayer\fR updates and displays the list of currently available TV programmes.
Use \-\-type=radio for radio programmes. Each available programme has an alphanumeric identifier (\fBPID\fR).
.PP
In PVR mode, \fBget_iplayer\fR can be called from cron to record programmes on a schedule.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
Boolean options can be negated by adding a "no\-" prefix, e.g., \-\-no\-subtitles or \-\-no\-whitespace.
